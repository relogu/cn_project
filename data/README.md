# Data directory

This directory should contain the data for the project.
Some of these data will be created and saved here using the scripts in the repo, others have to be downloaded before starting to use the repo.

To download the important data it is sufficient to open a terminal in the repo folder and run the following commands:

```bash
cd data
# wget http://snap.stanford.edu/conflict/conflict_data.zip ## useless until now
wget https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-redditHyperlinks-body.tsv
wget https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-redditHyperlinks-title.tsv
```
